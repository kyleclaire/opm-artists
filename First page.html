        <h3><p style="color: aliceblue">OPM is also making waves beyond Filipino shores. The Philippines is a music-loving nation, </p>
            <p style="color: white"> and OPM plays a significant role in driving that passion. There is no doubt that Filipino talents are world-class</p> 
            <p style="color: white"> and deserve global recognition, especially the rising-pop groups. People play their songs and listen, perhaps while</p> 
            <p style="color: white">doing chores or to sing and dance along. From global exposure, various award nominations, and expanding fan bases, </p>
            <p style="color: white"> indeed the world needs to prepare for new generation Pinoy artists. But the rise to stardom is not achieved overnight.</p> 
            <p style="color: white">It has its fair share of countless training, exhausting preparations, and strategic promotions. </p>

            <p style="color: white">From 2010 to 2020, Philippine pop music or Pinoy pop went through a huge </p>
            <p style="color: white">metamorphosis in its increased quality, budget, investment and variety, matching the country's </p>
            <p style="color: white">rapid economic growth, and an accompanying social and cultural resurgence of its Asian identity. </p>
            <p style="color: white"> This was heard by heavy influence from K-pop and J-pop, a growth in Asian style ballads, idol groups, </p>
            <p style="color: white">and EDM, and less reliance on Western genres, mirroring the Korean wave and similar Japanese wave </p>
            <p style="color: white">popularity among millennial Filipinos and mainstream culture.</p></h3>
