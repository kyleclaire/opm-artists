        <h3><p style="color: aliceblue">ALAMAT is currently a 6-member male idol group from Philippines that sings in several local languages under Viva Artists Agency.</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">The group consists of Taneo, Mo, Tomás, R-ji, Alas and Jao. ALAMAT debuted on February 14, 2021, with their single “kbye“.</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">Even before the group was introduced, they were formed through “PWEDE: The National Boyband Search”. On October 29, 2020,</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">ALAMAT was introduced as a new boy group of Viva Records to the public through the facebook page of ALAMAT with 1,000 likes and 2,000 followers.</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">On November 5, 2020, the members or trainees of ALAMAT were introduced as Kin, Gami, Jao, R-Ji, Mo, Taneo, Tomas, Valfer, and pre-debut member Ambri,</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">but left the group in the same month and was replaced by Alas. The group also releases various solo songs and concepts, as well as remake songs</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">or covers, these can be seen on their YouTube Channel. On January 30, 2021 it was announced on the Facebook page that the group will graduate as a trainee</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">and the group's debut date was also announced via Facebook live. From their debut single “kbye” which features verses in seven different Filipino languages,</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">to their latest EP Pasulong which spotlights uniquely Pinoy experiences, the group puts the “P” in P-pop, in the most intentional way.</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue"> When the group formed in 2020, creative director Jason Paul Laxamana made sure that each member was fluent in the native language of their hometown.</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue"> The idea from the start was “to genuinely embody the Philippines,” as Jason said. The result is music unlike any we’ve heard before – bringing</p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">together the freshness of pop and the familiarity of tradition, anchored on the percussive nature of Filipino languages.</p>
